I'm giving a presentation at [Node.ninjas](http://www.meetup.com/sydney-node-ninjas/) tonight in Sydney. I've put together a talk about LevelDB and Node that covers:

 1. What LevelDB *is* and the basics of how it works
 2. A quick introduction to the core LevelDB libraries in Node: [LevelUP](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup) and [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown/)
 3. Some preaching about the awesomeness of modularity around a small, extensible core; including a whirlwind tour of the current, flourishing, LevelDB+Node ecosystem

It's this last point that excites me the most. There's some very smart people building some very clever pieces to the *Node Database* puzzle. What's more, people are actually building functional databases in Node now, I've just collected a list from npm of what looks like functional databases that use LevelDB:

 * Rumours
 * LevelGraph
 * PushDB
 * NeutrinoDB
 * PlumbDB
 * Syncstore

And a few more that look like a work in progress. Plus, I'm sure there's more people out there we've never even heard of who are cooking up some amazing things using the LevelDB+Node combination!
