      <p><strong><a href="http://campjs.com/">CampJS</a></strong> has just finished, with a bigger crowd than last time around. It was lots of fun, and as usual, these events are more about meeting the people I collaborate, and socialise with online than anything else. There was a particularly large turn-out of the hackers on #polyhack, our Australian programmers channel on Freenode. Even <a href="https://twitter.com/mwotton">@mwotton</a>, our resident Haskell-troll was there! Lots of photos and news can be found on <a href="http://storify.com/campjs/campjs-ii">Storify</a>. The next one will likely be near Melbourne in February some time and I highly recommend it if you can get there.</p>
<h3>Learn You The Node.js For Much Win (presentation)</h3>
<p>I was struck last CampJS how many JavaScript newbies were there, or at least people who deal with JavaScript as a secondary language and therefore only have a cursory understanding of it. And by extension, there were not many people who had much understanding of Node. So I wanted to present some intro-to-Node material this time.</p>
<p>I gave a 30 minute talk covering the very basics of <em>what Node <strong>is</strong></em>, called <strong>Learn You The Node.js For Much Win</strong>. Obviously the title is inspired by <em><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell For Great Good</a></em> and <em><a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good</a></em>. You can find my slides <a href="http://r.va.gg/presentations/campjs-learn-you-node/">here</a> (feel free to rip them off if you need to give a similar talk somewhere!). The video may be online at some point in the future.</p>
<h3>Learn You The Node.js For Much Win (workshop)</h3>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BRWaBeeCcAA9R7v.jpg" style="border-radius:4px; border: solid 2px white; box-shadow: 1px 1px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.4);"></p>
<p>The next morning, I gave a workshop on the same topic but it was much more hands-on. The inspiration for my workshop came from <a href="http://www.nodeconf.com/">NodeConf</a>, a couple of months earlier. <a href="https://twitter.com/substack">@substack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maxogden">@maxogden</a> presented a workshop titled <strong>stream adventure</strong> which was a self-guided, interactive workshop for the terminal, built with Node. You can find it <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-adventure">here</a> and install it from npm with <code>npm install stream-adventure -g</code>, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p><a href="https://nodei.co/npm/stream-adventure/"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/stream-adventure.png?downloads=true&amp;stars=true" alt="NPM"></a></p>
<p>I was so inspired that I stole their code and made my own workshop application! <strong><a href="https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode/">learnyounode</a></strong>. You can download and install it with <code>npm install learnyounode -g</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://nodei.co/npm/learnyounode/"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/learnyounode.png?downloads=true&amp;stars=true" alt="NPM"></a></p>
<p>The application itself is/was a series of 13 separate workshops. Starting off with a simple <em>HELLO WORLD</em> and ending with a JSON API HTTP server (contributed by the very clever <a href="https://twitter.com/sidorares">@sidorares</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/rvagg/learnyounode/master/learnyounode.png" alt="learnyounode"></p>
<p>Nobody actually managed to finish the workshops in the allotted 60 minutes, although <a href="http://twitter.com/alexdickson">@alexdickson</a>, an expert JavaScripter but Node-n00b was the first one I heard of finishing it not long after.</p>
<p>The workshops attempt to focus on some of the core concepts of Node. There&#39;s lots of console output because that&#39;s easiest to validate but it introduces filesystem I/O, both synchronous and asynchronous and moves straight on to networking because that&#39;s what Node is so good at. An <em>HTTP CLIENT</em> example, introduces HTTP and is expanded on in <em>HTTP COLLECT</em> which introduces streams. <em>JUGGLING ASYNC</em> builds on <em>HTTP COLLECT</em> to introduce the complexities of managing parallel asynchronous activities. From there, it switches from network clients to network servers, first a simple TCP server in <em>TIME SERVER</em> and then using streams to serve files in <em>HTTP FILE SERVER</em> and transforming data with <em>HTTP UPPERCASERER</em>. The final exercise presents you with a more complex, closer-to-real-world example, an HTTP API server with multiple end-points.</p>
<p>The entire workshop is designed to take longer than 1-hour, people ought to be able ot take it away and complete it later. It&#39;s also designed to be suitable for complete n00bs and also people with some experience, it ought to make a fun challenge for anyone already experienced with Node to see how quickly they can complete the examples (I believe I earned the honour of being the first person at NodeConf to finish stream-adventure in the allotted time!).</p>
<p>The Node-experts at CampJS were thankfully helping out during the workshop so there wasn&#39;t much competition going on there.</p>
<p>Many thanks to these expert Node nerds who hovered and helped people during the workshop and also did some test-driving of the workshop prior to the event:</p>

<li><a href="https://twitter.com/EugeneWare">Eugene Ware</a> (who was also brilliant all weekend, running the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet">sneakernet</a> because the network was so flakey)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(I really hope I haven&#39;t missed anyone out there; so many quality nerds at CampJS!)</em></p>

<p><em>Tim Oxley making a contribution during the workshop, along with Christopher Giffard (left) and Eugene Ware (right)</em></p>
<p>I had the <a href="http://r.va.gg/presentations/campjs-learn-you-node/workshop.html">solutions</a> to the workshop ready on the big-screen and walked through some of the early solutions and talked through what was going on. I didn&#39;t expect many people to listen to those bits and the workshop was designed so you could totally zone-out and do it at your own pace if that suited.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to run a similar style workshop for their local meet-up, using the same content, I&#39;d love to receive contributions to <strong>learnyounode</strong>. Alternatively, make your own! I extracted the core framework from <strong>learnyounode</strong> and it now lives separately as <strong><a href="https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper">workshopper</a></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://nodei.co/npm/workshopper/"><img src="https://nodei.co/npm/workshopper.png?downloads=true&amp;stars=true" alt="NPM"></a></p>
<p>I would love feedback from anyone in attendance or anyone that uses this tool to run their own workshops! <strong>learnyounode</strong> is already listed in Max Ogden&#39;s excellent <strong><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node">The Art of Node</a></strong>, so I&#39;m looking forward to contributions to help turn this into a really useful teaching tool.</p>
