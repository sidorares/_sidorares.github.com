I visited lovely Dublin last month to attend [PeerConf](http://peerconf.com/). While there I got to meet a great bunch of Irish programmers at [Node.js Dublin](http://www.nodejsdublin.com/), a semi-regular Node.js meet-up that happens in the [Engine Yard](https://www.engineyard.com/) office in Dublin.

I was invited to give a presentation on LevelDB and the work that I've been doing on it in Node.js. I was followed by [Dominic Tarr](https://github.com/dominictarr) who's doing some amazing work on top of LevelDB.

You can view my slides [here](http://r.va.gg/presentations/nodejsdub/) but a written version is currently being spread over 3 parts on [DailyJS](http://dailyjs.com). More about that soon!
