[LevelUP](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup) is still quite young and bound to go through some major shifts. It's best to not be too tied to immature APIs early in a project's lifetime.

That said, we're very interested in stability so we try to keep breaking changes to a minimum. However, we're about to publish version 0.9 and there's one change that's not exactly a "breaking" change in the normal sense, but it is something that I need to explain because it will impact on almost everyone currently using LevelUP.

### Severing the dependency on LevelDOWN

LevelUP depends on [LevelDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown/) to do its *LevelDB thing*. LevelDOWN was once part of LevelUP until we split it off to a discrete project that focuses entirely on acting as a direct C++ bridge between LevelDB and Node. We get to focus on making LevelUP an awesome LevelDB-ish interface without being tied directly to LevelDB implementation details (e.g. Iterators vs Streams).

In fact, a new project was spawned to define the LevelDOWN interface that LevelUP requires. [AbstractLevelDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/node-abstract-leveldown) is a set of strict tests for the functionality that LevelUP uses and it also implements a basic abstract shell that can be extended to create additional back-ends for LevelUP.

So far, there are 3 projects worth mentioning that extend AbstractLevelDOWN:

 * **[level.js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)** operates on top of [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB) (which is in turn implemented on top of [LevelDB](https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) in Chrome!).

 * **[leveldown-gap](https://github.com/No9/node-leveldown-gap)** is another browser implementation that uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Storage#localStorage) and is designed to be able to work in [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) applications.

 * **[MemDOWN](https://github.com/rvagg/node-memdown)** is a pure in-memory implementation that doesn't touch the disk. It's obviously not good for persistent data but sometimes that's not what you need.

Plus some other efforts to adapt other embedded and non-embedded data stores to the LevelDOWN interface. Additionally, there are other versions of LevelDB that can be used, including the fork that [Basho](http://basho.com/) maintains for use in [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/). (I have a branch of LevelDOWN that uses this version of LevelDB that I'll release as soon as I can explain and demonstrate the performance differences to vanilla LevelDB for Node users).

In short, LevelUP doesn't *need* LevelDOWN in the way it once did and LevelUP is turning into a more generic interface to sorted key/value storage systems, albeit with a distinct LevelDB-flavour.

Since version 0.8 we've supported a `'db'` option when you create a LevelUP instance. This option can be used to provide an alternative LevelDOWN-compatible back-end. Unfortunately, LevelDOWN being defined as a strict dependency of LevelUP means that each time you install it you have to compile LevelDOWN, even if you don't want it. So, we've removed it as a dependency but it's still *wired up* so that that the only thing you need to do is actually install LevelDOWN alongside LevelUP and it'll take care of the rest.

```sh
$ npm install levelup leveldown
```

From version 0.9 onwards, you'll need to do this, or you'll see an (informative) error.

### Introducing "Level"

To make life easier, we're publishing an additional package in npm that will make this easier by bundling both LevelUP and LevelDOWN as dependencies and exposing LevelUP directly. The **[Level](https://github.com/level/level)** package is a very simple wrapper that exists purely as a convenience. It'll track the same versioning as LevelUP so it's a straight substitution.

```sh
$ npm install level
```

You can simply change your `"dependencies"` from **"levelup"** to **"level"**, plus you can use it just like LevelUP:

```js
var levelup = require('level')
var db = levelup('./my.db')
db.put('yay!', 'it works!')
```

### Switching things up

Now we have a properly pluggable back-end, expect to see a growing array of choice and innovation. The most exciting space at the moment is browser-land. Consider **level.js**:

```js
var levelup = require('levelup')
  , leveljs = require('level-js')

window.db = levelup('foo', { db: leveljs })

db.put('name', 'LevelUP string', function (err) {
  db.get('name', function (err, value) {
    console.log('name=' + value)
  })
})
```

Yep, that's browser code. Simply `npm install levelup level-js` and run the module through [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and you get the full LevelUP API in your browser!
